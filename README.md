## Background
The Luigi Mangione case involves the assassination of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, which took place on December 4, 2024, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, is the prime suspect in this high-profile murder. Thompson was shot in a targeted attack outside the New York Hilton Midtown hotel while on his way to the company’s annual investors' meeting. The gunman, identified as Mangione, used a 3D-printed "ghost gun" equipped with a silencer and fled the scene after the shooting. Evidence at the crime scene included shell casings inscribed with the words "deny," "delay," and "depose," a reference to the phrase "delay, deny, defend," often criticized as a tactic used by insurance companies to avoid paying claims.

Mangione was arrested five days later, on December 9, 2024, at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, following a nationwide manhunt. At the time of his arrest, he was found with a 3D-printed pistol matching the murder weapon, a silencer, fake IDs, and a handwritten note expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and corporate greed. The note reportedly included phrases like "these parasites had it coming," suggesting a motive tied to frustration with the U.S. healthcare system. Mangione, born into a prominent Maryland family with ties to real estate and healthcare businesses, had no direct connection to UnitedHealthcare as a client but appeared driven by broader resentment toward the industry.

Legally, Mangione faces both state and federal charges. On December 17, 2024, a Manhattan grand jury indicted him on 11 state charges, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, second-degree murder, and weapons-related offenses. The terrorism charge stems from prosecutors’ assertion that the killing was intended to "intimidate or coerce a civilian population" and "evoke terror," as stated by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Federally, he faces four charges, including murder and stalking, which could make him eligible for the death penalty. Mangione pleaded not guilty to the state charges on December 23, 2024, during his arraignment in New York State Supreme Court. His attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, has argued that the case has been politicized, citing conflicting legal theories between state and federal prosecutors and concerns over a fair trial due to public and official statements.

The case has sparked significant public reaction, with some online communities praising Mangione as a "folk hero" amid widespread anger toward the U.S. healthcare system. Hashtags like "#FreeLuigi" have gained traction, reflecting frustration over insurance practices, though officials, including NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, have condemned such sentiments as "vile" and "reckless." Mangione’s next court appearance is scheduled for February 21, 2025, as the state and federal cases proceed in parallel, with the state trial expected to occur first. The assassination has also reignited debates about healthcare reform in the United States.
